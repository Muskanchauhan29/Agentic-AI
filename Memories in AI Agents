Their are two types of memory -
 1. Short term memory (STM)
 2. Long term memory (LTM)

STM -> it holds only when the session is ongoing, while the task is getting performed
LTM -> it stays forever 
       like your name
       like your age 
(MongoDB, Qdrant, Graph)

3 types of LTM which is good for storing data for long time ->

1. Factual memory -> What kind of memory which we always want to retrieve
-> Its like facts about user 
like -> name, age, location 
this is always there is context
its short form of answer


2. Episodic memory -> What kind of memory we retrieve on demand 
-> information about previous interaction 
it fetch from db and give user the answer 


3. semantic memory -> Stores the Data in memory over time
Its kind of General information 
real world memory kinda



Next step set up Mem0
