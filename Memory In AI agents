Memory in AI Agents & LLMs
📌 Overview

This repository explores memory mechanisms in AI agents and Large Language Models (LLMs).
It focuses on how agents store, retrieve, update, and use past information to perform better over time instead of responding statelessly.

Memory is a key component for building autonomous, context-aware, and intelligent agents.

🚀 Why Memory Matters in AI Agents

Traditional LLM calls are stateless — they forget everything after a response.
Adding memory enables agents to:

Maintain long conversations

Learn from past interactions

Personalize responses

Make better decisions over time

Simulate human-like reasoning

🧩 Types of Memory Covered
1️⃣ Short-Term Memory (STM)

Stores recent conversation context

Usually window-based (last N messages)

Used for coherent multi-turn conversations

2️⃣ Long-Term Memory (LTM)

Persistent storage across sessions

Stored in databases or vector stores

Enables recall of old conversations, facts, or user preferences

3️⃣ Episodic Memory

Stores past interactions or events

Helps agents reflect on previous outcomes

4️⃣ Semantic Memory

Stores facts, concepts, and learned knowledge

Retrieved using embeddings and similarity search

5️⃣ Working Memory

Temporary memory used during reasoning or planning

Cleared after task completion

🛠️ Memory Techniques Used

Conversation buffers

Summarization-based memory

Vector embeddings (semantic search)

External databases

Checkpointing agent state

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

🧪 Example Use Cases

Chatbots with long-term user context

AI personal assistants

Autonomous agents

Multi-step reasoning systems

AI tutors and mentors

Simulation and planning agents

🧱 Tech Stack (Optional – Customize)

Python

Large Language Models (OpenAI / Open-source LLMs)

Vector Databases (FAISS / Chroma / Pinecone)

LangChain / LangGraph

MongoDB / PostgreSQL (for persistence)

⚙️ How It Works (High Level)

User input is received

Relevant memory is retrieved

Context is injected into the LLM prompt

Response is generated

New memory is stored or updated

📈 Future Improvements

Memory prioritization

Forgetting mechanisms

Self-reflection loops
